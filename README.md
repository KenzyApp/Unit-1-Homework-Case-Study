# FinTech Case Study: Remitly

## Overview and Origin

* Company Name: Remitly

* Incorporated: 2011

* Founded by: Matthew Oppenheimer, Josh Hug, & Shivaas Gulati

**How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**
>One of the founders, Matthew Oppenheimer, experienced first hand how difficult it was to send money to and from the United States while he was living abroad. This is why he wanted to create a way for people to conveniently send money back and forth internationally, in a convenient and cost effective way. He recognized the rapidly growing market for smartphones; a technology he could take advantage of for this product.

**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**
>Remitly is backed by more than a dozen investors, including PayU, Stripe Group, and Bezos Expeditions for a total of $175 million in funding. The company, as of 2020, is valued at $1.5 billion. 


## Business Activities:

**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
>Remitly was “Founded initially to disrupt the nearly $500 billion remittance industry.” In the ‘about’ video on Remitly’s website, one of the founders mentions that 8% of all of the profit that other remittance companies make was coming from fees they charge their customers. The founders believe that most of these remittance companies are not upfront and honest about their fee policies. By utilizing technology, specifically smartphones, Remitly is able to provide the same remittance services at a significantly lower cost to the consumer. In addition, this is extremely convenient for consumers.  

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
>The intended customers for Remitly are foreign migrants who need to send money to their home countries. As the international migrant population grows, so does this market size. The global remittance market is currently valued at about $600 billion, and is rapidly growing. This is mostly dominated by banks.

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
>Remitly has a solution that provides access to their services anytime, anywhere. That is the benefit and unfair advantage of developing a service that consists entirely online. They also provide multiple options for how the money is received. They even offer home delivery, where money can be delivered to the recipient's home in a few days. For example, during the pandemic banks took a hit in the remittance market. The market was expected to decline about 20% in 2020. However, Remitly actually saw customer growth. This is due to the uniqueness of what they offer. 

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**
>Remitly is currently an app for smartphones as well as a website. They utilize technologies such as jQuery, NGINX, React, Java, BootStrap, CodeIgniter, and more.
