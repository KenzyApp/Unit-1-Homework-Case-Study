# FinTech Case Study: Remitly

## Overview and Origin

* Company Name: Remitly

* Incorporated: 2011

* Founded by: Matthew Oppenheimer, Josh Hug, & Shivaas Gulati

**How did the idea for the company come about?**
>One of the founders, Matthew Oppenheimer, experienced first hand how difficult it was to send money to and from the United States while he was living abroad. This is why he wanted to create a way for people to conveniently send money back and forth internationally, in a convenient and cost effective way. He recognized the rapidly growing market for smartphones; a technology he could take advantage of for this product.

**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**
>Remitly is backed by more than a dozen investors, including PayU, Stripe Group, and Bezos Expeditions for a total of $175 million in funding. The company, as of 2020, is valued at $1.5 billion. 


## Business Activities:

**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
>Remitly was “Founded initially to disrupt the nearly $500 billion remittance industry.” In the ‘about’ video on Remitly’s website, one of the founders mentions that 8% of all of the profit that other remittance companies make was coming from fees they charge their customers. The founders believe that most of these remittance companies are not upfront and honest about their fee policies. By utilizing technology, specifically smartphones, Remitly is able to provide the same remittance services at a significantly lower cost to the consumer. In addition, this is extremely convenient for consumers.  

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
>The intended customers for Remitly are foreign migrants who need to send money to their home countries. As the international migrant population grows, so does this market size. The global remittance market is currently valued at about $600 billion, and is rapidly growing. This is mostly dominated by banks.

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
>Remitly has a solution that provides access to their services anytime, anywhere. That is the benefit and unfair advantage of developing a service that consists entirely online. They also provide multiple options for how the money is received. They even offer home delivery, where money can be delivered to the recipient's home in a few days. For example, during the pandemic banks took a hit in the remittance market. The market was expected to decline about 20% in 2020. However, Remitly actually saw customer growth. This is due to the uniqueness of what they offer. 

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?**
>Remitly is currently an app for smartphones as well as a website. They utilize technologies such as jQuery, NGINX, React, Java, BootStrap, CodeIgniter, and more.



## Landscape:

**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**
>Global Remittance

**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**
>This domain has been completely changed in the last 10 years with the intervention of technology. Whereas this domain was dominated by banks and large remittance companies such as Western Union, technology has allowed for smaller, newer companies to enter the space. The process has become much more convenient for consumers with the ability to send and receive money online, and it has also allowed for companies to send money more cost effectively. This has thus made the domain much more competitive, to the advantage of the consumer. 

**What are the other major companies in this domain?**
> - Western Union
> - MoneyGram
> - Wells Fargo
> - Chase
> - MasterCard Send 


## Results

**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**
>Remitly has grown significantly since it began, but has seen even more significant growth within the last year amidst the coronavirus pandemic. Since Remitly’s goal is to operate at a significantly cheaper rate than their competitors, they have changed the remittance domain permanently. Other companies have had to change their methods and strategies for making remittances in order to stay competitive with a company that can offer consumers a competitive price and the convenience of a mobile app. 

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**
>The remittance domain is measured not only by profit, but also by customer growth. One way that Remitly measures their success is based on the number of customers using their services, as well as the percent of customer growth from year to year. For instance, currently they have about 3 million customers worldwide, and their customer base increased by 200% this year. In contrast to this, the remittance domain as a whole saw a decline in customer base this year, so this metric is extremely positive for Remitly. They also measure their success through the number of sending and receiving countries they service. Currently, Remitly offers the ability to send from 17 countries, and the ability to receive from 57 countries. This is a significant range of countries for this domain, which they attribute to the convenience of their mobile app.

**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**
>Although Remitly is not on the same scale as some of the major banks that offer remittance services, or other large money transfer companies, they are competitive in the domain. Forbes ranked Remitly as the best company for sending money from the developed world to the developing world. It was also listed on Forbes’s FinTech 50 list in 2019.

## Recommendations

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**
>Right now, Remitly offers a wide range of delivery methods for the funds they send. This includes direct deposit to a bank account, cash pickup, mobile money accounts, and home delivery. This is major when thinking about remote locations where people do not always have a bank account, or a way to safely pick up their received money. With that being said, Remitly may be many people’s only financial service application. I think that gives them a unique opportunity to expand the kind of products and services they offer their customers. One thing that might be intriguing for these kinds of customers would be money management/growth tools, similar to what we see currently on personal finance apps. This could mean adopting some of the technologies that apps such as Acorns uses - taking change out of your account and investing it. Or offer budgeting options similar to the Mint app. 

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
>I think that the adoption of these products/services would benefit the company in profit as well as customer base. As mentioned, Remitly has an advantage in markets where customers do not generally have bank accounts. This is why Remitly has been so successful with their wide range of money delivery options. But this also means that their customers, who already know and use their products, may be in need of more finance products and services - they are just not readily available to them. Not only would these kinds of technologies be beneficial for Remitly, they also could be beneficial to the customers and their finances. 

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
>As mentioned, the investing technologies that are used by the app Acorns would be utilized in this additional service for Remitly. As Remitly is a micro-lending app, it seems only natural that they also adopt micro-investing. Essentially, Remitly could just take a few dollars of each transaction, and virtually invest the funds for their customer, the same way that the Acorns app does. They could also build on to their current app and add a feature that helps customers budget. 

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
>I believe these technologies are appropriate for Remitly’s business because they target the same group of customers. It would be convenient for customers to have all of their finance services in one app, and it would be extremely unique. Most consumers use a number of different apps to manage their personal finances. It would be a unique advantage for Remitly to offer all of these services in one app, and have customers be automatically enrolled in the services. It is one less thing to think about as a consumer, and an opportunity for growth for Remitly.
